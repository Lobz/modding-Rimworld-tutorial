# Modding Rimworld for absolute noobs

# Introduction

Hey there, I'm Oz, and I had a lot of trouble getting into Rimworld modding because I was unfamiliar with the tools, concepts and languages used in most tutorials, and I work better if I can start with basic instructions that will give me fast and easy results. I don't want to have to install MS Visual Studio and learn C# before I even have a basic proof-of-concept mod working - a "Hello, World" project, like we say in programming.

After making my first mod, I decided to create a series of very short, easy tutorials, requiring no special programs, and introducing the most basic kind of mods before going forward to more complicated ones. The first part will teach you how to make a barebones mod that will show up in your Mods window in Rimworld, but not actually change anything. The second part will show how to change some small trait in the game. The third will show how to create a new thing in Rimworld. After that, we will go into mods that require actual coding (which is where most tutorials I've seen begin).

Basically, I want to make the kind of guide I wish I had when I got here. I hope we can learn together.
